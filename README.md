# Furaha - Flutter Application

The purpose of this project is to build a mental healthcare solution in the form of a mobile application named Furaha. Furaha aims to help people who are dealing with stress, anxiety and other adverse effects brought about by the COVID-19 virus, and its side effects through a variety of tools, services, functionalities and self-care content. 

With the solution, I have provided the following functionalities:

- User Registration to allow them to be able to create accounts with the application.
- Sign in and sign out options.
- Access to articles based on stress, thinking positively, etc (sourced from researched and licensed professionals) on self-care.
- A demo feature to allow users to find and book sessions with licensed mental healthcare practitioners.
